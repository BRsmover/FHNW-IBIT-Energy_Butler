    <h1>The Functionality</h1>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The purpose of Energy Butler is to reduce the energy consumption of devices as well as connecting your smart
        devices in your home. Our software will help you reduce the energy costs in your home and shows you how well
        youâ€™re doing in saving energy.</p>
    <p>You can choose between a regular time period where Energy Butler shows your energy report. Or you will be able to
        generate this report at any time and you can compare your energy consumption with other users. We provide you
        with a benchmark of all devices which are used and you will see if your energy level is in a good range or where
        you can save energy by reducing the time your device is switched on but not used.</p>
    <p>Specify your devices as a single device or groups of devices. In this way you will be able to easy control
        devices of the same group at once. For example, changing their power state with just one click or automatically
        in your defined time frame.</p>
    <p>We will add always more devices and brands so you can enlarge your smart house. To guarantee a constant
        compatibility, your devices should receive soft- or firmware updates by the manufacturers.</p>
